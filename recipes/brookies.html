        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This brookie recipe was inspired by a co-worker who couldn't decide if she wanted brownies or chocolate chip cookies for her birthday treat. 
            Since she said I should just pick one, I thought this up on the way home. I couldn't find a recipe like it on Allrecipes, so I created it. 
            These brookies go quickly; I usually make a double batch in a jelly roll pan.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare cookie layer: Beat 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla in a large bowl until creamy. 
                Add one egg; beat until light and creamy, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk 1 1/4 cups flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and baking soda in a bowl. 
                Gradually stir flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is combined. Stir chocolate chips into dough. 
                Spread dough evenly into the prepared baking dish; set aside.

                Mix in cocoa powder until well-combined. Stir in 1/2 cup flour, baking powder, and 1/8 teaspoon salt until batter is combined.
